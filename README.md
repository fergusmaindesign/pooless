# <h1><strong>Flushed away</strong></h1>

<h2>Entertain me for a moment... There's something about being perched on a public pooper that gets the juices flowing in a little more than a literal sense - Caught in an interlude of cautious calm, falling into a familiar mindfulness, I was jolted abruptly by the swirling flood of the auto-flush on the loo I was throning, triggered by a sensor impractically positioned behind my head .</h2>
