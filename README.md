<h2>Let's talk about the fragility of technology and why our reliance on an increasingly leaky system isn't the end of the  :earth_asia:  (yet)... Keep it casual though</h2>

<h3>Entertain me for a moment... There's something about being perched on a public pooper that gets the juices flowing in a little more than a literal sense - Caught in an interlude of cautious calm, falling into a familiar mindfulness, I was jolted abruptly by the swirling flood of the auto-flush on the loo I was throning, triggered by a sensor impractically positioned behind my head.</h3>

<p1>Right. You are probably a little baffled by the above :shit: anecdote but this experience made me think about why it is that the traditional flusher, that you would pull down and that would flush without fail time after time, has kicked the can and are being replaced by what could be summed as an arguably over-complicated, often irritating alternative. My experience as a result of this techilogical 'evolvement' is a strung example of todays evolving tech being fragile from the experience of the user

  As we push technology to an increasingly advanced state in our generally collective desire to further intergrate the digital and real world, we are seeing the longevity of both hardware and software become less and less and the security of the networks we rely more and more on become increasingly vulnerable and prone to stumbling. In our ballooning impatience, one might say we are running before we can even walk - Now whilst this systemic trait is something to be incredibly weary of, by no means am I nudging the idea that we purge the digital bits from here on in and sing through cups and string. 
  
  What I want to touch on and encourage having read about the topic, is the need and work being done to manage our digital vulnerabilities in an evermore volatile (lets talk about out how in a mo) cyber-world.
  
  Think back to May 2017, WannaCry runs rampant, a nasty bout of ransomware spreading through computers operating Microsoft Windows. User’s files were held hostage, and a Bitcoin ransom was demanded for their return. Were it not for the continued use of outdated computer systems and poor education around the need to update software, the damage caused by this attack could have been avoided. It's reported WannaCry amounted 4$ billion+ [!] in global losses.
  
  This attack is one of countless but helps illustrate how breakable our existing system is - But there is hope for us yet. It's become an underwhelming and overlooked aspect in the haze of innovation, but the foundations on which we build our techy empires on is simply a sea of ones and zeros (binary code). It is binary code that provides the key to swirving digital doom, a universal language that courses through every ounce of tech we adopt! To analogise, It is as if the driving system, the engine and the petrol of the car were all made of the same interchangeable substance. Or as if bottles and glasses were made of solid ice, and you could use them to pour and drink water. Thanks to what can be labelled as reflexivity, our digital creations are able to work with themselves, on themselves, for themselves. WannaCry infected so many computers because too many did not have the necessary updates to block it, forgetting that reflexivity does indeed make the digital so fragile, since malware too is made of zeros and one, but it is also what allows the digital to defend itself, with an antivirus for example.
  
  So a large part of the future success of tech that will no doubt remain vulnerable and most-likely increasingly fragile, I think, is in large to place increasing emphasis on regulated automation and universal communication between provider, consumer and those who regulate - the underlying pillars of what many see tech to encourage and manifest.
  
  More formally, as we head down this road of faster, more incremental changes, what we are giving up in simplicity and perceived stability we are making up for in being able to rapidly respond to security flaws, uptime problems, and usability issues. We are learning that overcoming fragility is not just a goal, but a process.</p>
