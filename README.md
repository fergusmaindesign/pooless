You are probably a little baffled by the above :shit: anecdote but this experience made me think about why it is that the traditional flusher has kicked the can and are being replaced by what could be summed as an arguably over-complicated, often irritating alternative. My experience as a result of this techilogical 'evolvement' is an example of tech being fragile.
